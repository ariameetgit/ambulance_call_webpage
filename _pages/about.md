## 🚑 When Every Second Counts

Imagine someone dials **999** because a family member has collapsed. The operator on the phone has to make a split-second decision: **Is this a life-threatening emergency?**

Sometimes, it's hard to tell. The caller might be panicking, crying, or unable to speak clearly.

**This is where our project comes in.** We are building a smart AI helper that listens to the call alongside the human operator to spot danger signs instantly.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Meet the "Voice Detective"

Our AI system is like a super-sensitive detective. It doesn't just "hear" words; it listens for hidden clues in the sound itself.

It looks for two types of clues:

1.  **The Words (Text):** * Did the caller say *"Chest pain"* or *"Not breathing"*?
    * *Think of this like reading subtitles.*
2.  **The Sound (Audio):**
    * Is the caller gasping for air?
    * Is their voice shaking with extreme panic?
    * Is there a loud crash in the background?
    * *Think of this like understanding the "mood" of the sound.*

### 🚦 How It Works (The 3 Steps)

You don't need to be a computer scientist to understand how it works. It follows three simple steps:

#### Step 1: Listening 👂
The AI listens to the live audio from the ambulance call.

#### Step 2: Thinking 🧠
It converts the voice into text (like Siri does) and analyzes the sound waves. It compares this call to thousands of past emergency calls to see if it matches a "Category 1" (Life-Threatening) pattern.

#### Step 3: Alerting 🚨
If the AI thinks the patient is in critical danger, it flashes a **Red Light** on the operator's screen. This helps the operator send an ambulance immediately.

### ❓ Why Do We Need This?

* **Humans get tired:** Operators work long shifts and can get stressed. AI never gets tired.
* **Speed matters:** In a cardiac arrest, every minute without help reduces survival chances by 10%. Our AI tries to save those precious minutes.

> **Important Note:** The AI does NOT replace humans. It is just a helpful tool—like a co-pilot—to make sure no emergency is missed.
